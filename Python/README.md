Step 1: Go to [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). There, you should find a download button and choose your operating system (e.g. Windows), and the desired python version (e.g. Python 3.6).                
Step 2: After installation, launch Anaconda Navigator.          
Step 3: Choose your prefered IDE (Spyder, Jupyter Notebook, Vscode...).      
Step 4: In the case you've chosen Spyder, copy and paste the following:        
```
def myfirstfunction():
    import math

    square_root_of_2 = math.sqrt(2)
    print("Hello world! sqrt of 2 is ..." + str(square_root_of_2))



myfirstfunction()     
```
Step 5: If this has been done precisely, press the "Run" button.     
Step 6: In the console, the correct output should be: "Hello world! sqrt of 2 is ...1.4142135623730951"

    Way 1

Step 1: Open command line, and copy the following:    
ProgramData\Anaconda3\python.exe "C:\noi\iulia\prj\Topics-Sensation\Python\Hello_World_Python_Coding.py"
Step 2: Simply press enter, your output *should* look like this:    
"Hello world! sqrt of 2 is ...1.4142135623730951"

    Way 2  
Step 1: Open Anaconda Prompt.
Step 2: Copy and paste the following line, and paste it in the Anaconda Prompt: python "C:\noi\iulia\prj\Topics-Sensation\Python\Hello_World_Python_Coding.py"
Step 3: Once that has been accomplished, press enter, and the correct output should be: "Hello world! sqrt of 2 is ...1.4142135623730951"
